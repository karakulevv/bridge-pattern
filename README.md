# Bridge Design Pattern Example

This is a C# example illustrating the Bridge design pattern. The example demonstrates how the Bridge pattern can be employed to separate abstraction from implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. In this scenario, the pattern is applied to a shape drawing application where different shapes are drawn using various rendering techniques.

## Pattern Components

### 1. Abstraction: `Shape`

**Purpose:** Abstraction representing a shape.

**Explanation:** Contains a reference to the `IRenderer` interface for rendering and declares an abstract method `Draw`.

### 2. Implementor: `IRenderer`

**Purpose:** Interface for the implementation classes.

**Explanation:** Declares methods for rendering circles and squares.

### 3. Concrete Implementor: `VectorRenderer`

**Purpose:** Concrete implementation providing vector-based rendering.

**Explanation:** Implements the `IRenderer` interface methods for rendering circles and squares using vector rendering.

### 4. Concrete Implementor: `RasterRenderer`

**Purpose:** Concrete implementation providing raster-based rendering.

**Explanation:** Implements the `IRenderer` interface methods for rendering circles and squares using raster rendering.

### 5. Concrete Abstraction: `Circle`

**Purpose:** Concrete abstraction representing a circle.

**Explanation:** Extends the `Shape` class and delegates rendering to the associated renderer for drawing a circle.

### 6. Concrete Abstraction: `Square`

**Purpose:** Concrete abstraction representing a square.

**Explanation:** Extends the `Shape` class and delegates rendering to the associated renderer for drawing a square.

### 7. Client: `Program`

**Purpose:** Demonstrates how the Bridge pattern is used to draw different shapes with different rendering techniques.

**Explanation:** In the `Main` method, instances of `Circle` and `Square` are created with specific renderers, and the `Draw` method is called on each shape, illustrating how the abstraction and implementation can vary independently.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile and run the C# program.
3. Observe how the Bridge pattern is used to draw different shapes with different rendering techniques.

## Purpose

The Bridge pattern promotes the separation of abstraction and implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. It is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation and when changes in the implementation should not affect the clients. The example illustrates how the Bridge pattern facilitates the drawing of shapes with various rendering techniques in a flexible and extensible manner.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use cases to better understand how the Bridge pattern can be applied in software development.
